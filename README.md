# Rust Study Projects

This is where I practice building small Rust applications and modules.

## Projects:
- [Task API](task_api) – A simple REST API built with Axum
- [CLI Tool](cli_tool) – Coming soon!
- [Data Structures](data_structures) – Implementing basic structures like LinkedList, Stack, etc.
